package com.pluralsight.Capstone;

public class ReportService {

    //Purpose: Handles filtering and reporting logic
    //Contains:
    //- displayAllTransactions(List<Transaction>)
    //- displayDeposits(List<Transaction>)
    //- displayPayments(List<Transaction>)
    //- reportMonthToDate(List<Transaction>), etc.
    //You can keep these in Main for now, but if they grow large, moving them into a separate class like ReportService or LedgerUtils will keep things clean.
